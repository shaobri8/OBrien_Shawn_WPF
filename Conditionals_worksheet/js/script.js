 // The first thing that we need to do is figure out the variables.

 //var eff = prompt(" What is your cars mpg rating? ");
 //var gauge = prompt(" At what percent is your tank gauge reading? ");
 //var cap = prompt(" What is the capacity of the gas tank? ");

 // Now that we have the var figured out, we need to input a solution to figure out if we can make it.

 //if(eff>20 && gauge >= 75 && cap >= 20){prompt("Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!")


 //}else {prompt ("You don't have enough gas in your tank, better get gas now while you can!");}


 // I have made a formula to figure out if we can make it or not, however this formula does not include math.



//var percent = prompt(" What is the grade percent? ");
// Here we used an interface to find our variable.

 // we will use this variable to find out the grade below.
//if(percent >= 90){console.log ("You have earned a A in this class!")}
//if(percent >= 80 && percent<= 89){console.log ("You have earned a B in this class!")}
//if(percent >= 73 && percent<= 79){console.log ("You have earned a C in this class!")}
//if(percent >= 70 && percent<=72){console.log ("You have earned a D in this class!")}
//if(percent<= 69){console.log ("You have earned a F in this class!")}
// code as been tested and works properly.




// The next problem is finding out the price for a movie ticket. The first thing that we need to do is find out our
 // variables.

//The price of a ticket is $12, however this price varies by the time of showing and age of the customer, so these will
 // be our variables.

 // Now that our variables are set we need to create a prompt for the user.

var old = prompt("How old are you?");
var time = prompt("What time do you want to see the movie?");

// We now need to write the statement to find out the price of the ticket. Lets say any movie before 5 pm gets the
 //price of $7 and anyone who is over the age of 55 gets the price of $7 also. AND 7 is the lowest price available.

 if(old>=55 || time <=3){console.log("Your movie price will be $7")

 }else{console.log("Your movie price will be $12")}
// code has been tested and works.
