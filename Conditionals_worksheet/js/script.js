 // The first thing that we need to do is figure out the variables.

 //var eff = prompt(" What is your cars mpg rating? ");
 //var gauge = prompt(" At what percent is your tank gauge reading? ");
 //var cap = prompt(" What is the capacity of the gas tank? ");

 // Now that we have the var figured out, we need to input a solution to figure out if we can make it.

 //if(eff>20 && gauge >= 75 && cap >= 20){prompt("Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!")


 //}else {prompt ("You don't have enough gas in your tank, better get gas now while you can!");}


 // I have made a formula to figure out if we can make it or not, however this formula does not include math.



var percent = prompt(" What is the grade percent? ");
// Here we used an interface to find our variable.

 // we will use this variable to find out the grade below.
if(percent >= 90){console.log ("You have earned a A in this class!")}
if(percent >= 80 && percent<= 89){console.log ("You have earned a B in this class!")}
if(percent >= 73 && percent<= 79){console.log ("You have earned a C in this class!")}
if(percent >= 70 && percent<=72){console.log ("You have earned a D in this class!")}
if(percent<= 69){console.log ("You have earned a F in this class!")}
// code as been tested and works properly.
